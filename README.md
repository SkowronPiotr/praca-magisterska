# My most important project so far

## Technologies and tools used in project
### Python/Django, HTML, CSS
There are some additional function that helped me in this project. Data comes from matweb.com, I downloaded 30 records and through pandas and some SQL implemented them to models. Charts are displayed due to matplotlib usage.

## What you can do on this website

The website is a database containing superalloy records for, among others, the aviation or energy industries

User doesn't have to create account to use basic functions which are:
- Search records by descriptions and titles
- Filtering by categories
- Viewing data of individual species such as: mechanical values, chemical composition, physical values, data are presented numerically and in the form of charts
- Compare 2 records from database on separate website

A user who has an account may additionally:
- Create his own data record, edit and delete, these records are avaible to see for all users
